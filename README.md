# Made for Reddit: Artists I Know - About and Trends

This is a collection of trends and basic data of artists I like or have listened to atleast once in my lifetime...  
It provides you a list of Spotify links to artists' pages along with a link to an example song of each on Spotify.  

Each file shows a \``delta`\`. This represents the change in the monthly listener count of that artist from the last time a post was made...

### File names have been given in the following format
<DATE-OF-CALCULATION\>`_`<TIME-TAKEN-TO-RUN-PROGRAM-IN-SECONDS\>`.md`  
E.g. `10-10-21_2000.d` would mean that the program was run on 10th of October 2021 and took 2000 seconds to finish.

If filename has `UNKNOWN` as the time, then it means that the guy was extremely frustrated, but the program did not show guy how long it took to run...
so the guy couldn't possibly know how long the thing took to run, therefore ruining that dataset...

### Now go ahead, check out a file!
&nbsp;

### Some things you may want to know
- The list of artists may or may not keep growing
- All data has been taken from Spotify via `spotipy`, a Spotify API wrapper for Python  
- Time taken to calculate the data will be mentioned in the name of the file itself
- Newly added Artists will not have any change in monthly listener count, because no data for them was available before that time...
