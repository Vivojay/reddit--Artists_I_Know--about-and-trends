# Made for Reddit: Artists I Know - About and Trends

This is a collection of trends and basic data of artists I like or have listened to atleast once in my lifetime...
This provides you a list of Spotify links to artists' pages along with a link to an example song of each on Spotify.

Each file shows a \``delta`\`. This represents the change in the monthly listener count of that artist from the last time a post was made...


&nbsp;

### File names have been given in the following format
<DATE-OF-CALCULATION\>`_`<TIME-TAKEN-TO-RUN-PROGRAM-IN-SECONDS\>`.md`

E.g. 10-10-21_2000 would mean that the program was run on 10th of October 2021 and took 2000 seconds to finish.

### Some things you may want to know
- The list of artists may or may not keep growing
- All data has been taken from Spotify via `spotipy`, a Spotify API wrapper for Python  
- Time taken to calculate the data will be mentioned in the name of the file itself
